//! @brief A "transposition table" is a map of game state values referenced by a fingerprint.
//!
//! A game state can be the result of different sequences of the same (or a different) set of moves. This technique is used to
//! cache the value of a game state regardless of the moves used to reach it, thus the name "transposition" table. The purpose of
//! the "transposition" table has been extended to become simply a cache game state values, so it is more aptly named
//! "game state value cache" -- but the old name persists.
//!
//! As a speed and memory optimization in this implementation, slots in the table are not unique to the state being stored, and a
//! value may be overwritten when a new value is added. A value is overwritten only when its "quality" is less than or equal to the
//! "quality" of the value being added.
